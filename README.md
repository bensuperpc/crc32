# Fast CRC32

This is a mirror of my CRC32 library hosted at https://create.stephan-brumme.com/crc32/

## Features

- C++11, single file
- CMake support
- The fastest algorithms need about 1 CPU cycle per byte
- Endian-aware
- Support for [multi-threaded computation](example/crc32_test_multithreaded.cpp)
- Cross-plateform support: Linux 32/64, MacOS, Windows 32/64, Android 32/64
- Multi-plateform arch support: AMD64, I386, ARMv8, ARMv7, ARMv6, ARMv5, RISC-V 32/64, PPC64le, Mips, m68k..
- Runs even on [Arduino](Crc32Best.ino), Raspberry Pi, etc.
- Quite long posting about it on https://create.stephan-brumme.com/crc32/, describing each implemented algorithm in detail

## Algorithms

- bitwise
- branch-free bitwise
- half-byte
- tableless full-byte
- Sarwate's original algorithm
- slicing-by-4
- slicing-by-8
- slicing-by-16
- crc32_combine() "merges" two indepedently computed CRC32 values which is the basis for even faster multi-threaded calculation

See my website https://create.stephan-brumme.com/crc32/ for documentation, code examples and a benchmark.
